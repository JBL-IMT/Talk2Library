# Talk² Arduino Library #
This is the official Arduino Library for the Talk² Boards, like Whisper Node. Please note that the official repository is hosted at Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/talk2/talk2-library) but we also maintain a clone of the same repository at the GitHub (https://github.com/talk2wisen/Talk2Library) for the Arduino IDE requirements.

## Installation ##
This library is supported on the recent version of Arduino IDE >= 1.6.2. You can install it directly from the Arduino IDE by opening the menu "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries...". Search for "Talk2", select the most recent version and click "Install".

You also can manually install this library by creating a folder inside your "Sketches" folder and copying all content there. You'll need to restart the Arduino IDE to use the Library.

## Requirements ##

### RadioHead ###
This library requires the RadioHead library, which can be downloaded from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/. The documentation is very comprehensive and can be accessed on the same Website. Additionally a recent copy of the RadioHead library is available inside the "extras" directory.
